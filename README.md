Adventure Works Cycles â€“ Sales & Customer Insights:

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
In this project, I explored the Adventure Works Cycles dataset and turned raw sales data into meaningful insights. Using Tableau, Power BI, and Excel, I built dashboards that help the company understand
* Who their best (and least profitable) customers are.
* Which products and sub-products are driving most of the profit.
* How sales and profits change across time, regions, and product lines.
The idea was to give decision-makers a clear, interactive view of the business so they can focus on what really matters: boosting sales, cutting costs, and serving customers better.

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
Adventure Works Cycles, a multinational bicycle manufacturer, wanted to:
* Target their best customers with more precision.
* Expand product availability online.
* Reduce production and sales costs.
To do this, they needed a data-driven understanding of sales, customers, and product performance.

ðŸ”¹ My Approach & Solution
Hereâ€™s how I solved it:
* Data Preparation:
Cleaned and transformed Adventure Works datasets.
Prepared them for smooth analysis in Tableau, Power BI, and Excel.

* Analysis:
Looked at profit and sales trends across years, quarters, and months.
Analyzed product-wise and sub-product-wise contributions.
Segmented customers to identify top and bottom performers.

* Dashboards & Visuals:
Profit Analysis Dashboard â†’ Shows yearly/quarterly profits, country-wise contributions, and product category performance.
Top/Bottom Analysis Dashboard â†’ Highlights the most and least profitable products and customers, helping managers know where to focus.

* Key Insights
The US and Australia bring in over 60% of the companyâ€™s profit.
Road Bikes (47%) and Mountain Bikes (38%) dominate profit share.

A small group of customers contribute disproportionately to profits, while some bring almost zero contribution.

2013 was the peak profit year, with Q2 leading across all quarters.
